# The new services will automatically create required tables
# on first startup through SQLAlchemy metadata.create_all()
```

### 3. **Start Real-time Server**

```bash
# Start the enhanced MCP server with real-time features
python mcp_server_realtime.py

# Server starts on:
# - HTTP API: http://localhost:8000
# - WebSocket: ws://localhost:8000/ws
# - Admin Dashboard: http://localhost:8000/admin/dashboard
```

### 4. **Test WebSocket Connection**

```javascript
// Test WebSocket connection from browser console
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws');
ws.onopen = () => {
    // Send authentication (replace with actual JWT token)
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        type: 'auth',
        data: { token: 'YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' }
    }));
};
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log('Received:', JSON.parse(event.data));
```

### 5. **Access Admin Dashboard**

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Real-time Search with Notifications

```python
# Client performs search - automatic notifications sent via WebSocket
search_request = {
    "query": "machine learning algorithms",
    "sources": ["web", "arxiv", "pubmed"],
    "max_results": 20
}

# POST /search -> triggers WebSocket notifications:
# 1. search_started notification
# 2. search_progress updates (if long-running)
# 3. search_completed with results
# 4. search_history_updated notification
```

### Admin User Management

```python
# Admin promotes user to admin status
admin_action = {
    "action": "promote_admin",
    "reason": "Trusted power user promotion"
}

# POST /admin/users/{user_id}/action
# -> User promoted
# -> Audit log created
# -> WebSocket notification to all admins
```

### User Preference Management

```python
# User updates search preferences
preferences_update = {
    "default_sources": ["web", "arxiv"],
    "auto_save_searches": True,
    "search_history_retention_days": 180,
    "notification_settings": {
        "email_digest": True,
        "search_alerts": False
    }
}

# PUT /user/preferences
# -> Preferences updated in database
# -> Cache invalidated
# -> Real-time preference sync via WebSocket
```
