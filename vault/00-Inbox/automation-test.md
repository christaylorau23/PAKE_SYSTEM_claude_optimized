# Automation Test Note

This is a comprehensive test of the PAKE+ automation system. It should automatically:

- Calculate a confidence score based on content analysis
- Generate vector embeddings for semantic search
- Add AI-generated summaries to the frontmatter
- Update the knowledge graph with connections

## Content Analysis

This note contains:
- Multiple headers for structure
- Bullet points for organization
- Code blocks for technical content
- Links to other resources [example](https://example.com)

```python
def test_automation():
    """Test function to add technical content"""
    confidence = calculate_confidence(content)
    return confidence > 0.5
```

## Knowledge Areas

Tags that should be automatically processed:
- automation
- testing
- knowledge-management
- PAKE+

The system should recognize this as high-quality content due to its structure, length, and technical nature.
