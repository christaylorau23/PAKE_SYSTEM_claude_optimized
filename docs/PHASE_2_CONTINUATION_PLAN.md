# PAKE System - Phase 2 Foundation Integration & Performance Optimization

**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Status:** 🚀 IN PROGRESS  
**Building on:** Phase 1 Foundation Hardening (Completed)  
**Timeline:** Weeks 5-8  

---

## 🎯 Mission Objective

Integrate Phase 1 foundation components into the existing PAKE System architecture and implement performance optimization patterns. This phase bridges our newly implemented foundation hardening with the existing system components.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Foundation Components (COMPLETED)
- **Error Handling Framework**: Structured exceptions, correlation IDs, retry mechanisms
- **Distributed Caching**: Redis connectivity with authentication and circuit breaker protection  
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: State management, rate limiting, failure detection
- **Security Guards**: Prompt injection detection with pattern matching
- **Enhanced MCP Server**: FastAPI integration with all foundation components
