Contract Test: Monitoring Metrics Endpoints
Task T010 - Phase 18 Production System Integration

This test validates the Monitoring metrics exposition contract as defined in:
.specify/specs/phase-18-production-integration/contracts/monitoring.yaml

CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL before implementation exists.
This follows TDD methodology - Red, Green, Refactor.
