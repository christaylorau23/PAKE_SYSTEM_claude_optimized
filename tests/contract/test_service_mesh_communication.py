Contract Test: Service Mesh Inter-Service Communication
Task T009 - Phase 18 Production System Integration

This test validates the Service Mesh communication patterns as defined in:
.specify/specs/phase-18-production-integration/contracts/service-mesh.yaml

CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL before implementation exists.
This follows TDD methodology - Red, Green, Refactor.
