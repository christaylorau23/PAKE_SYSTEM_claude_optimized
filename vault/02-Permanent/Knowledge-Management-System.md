# PAKE+ Knowledge Management System

## Core Principles

The Personal Autonomous Knowledge Engine Plus (PAKE+) operates on several fundamental principles designed to maximize knowledge retention, validation, and actionable insight generation.

### 1. Confidence-Driven Architecture
Every knowledge item receives a dynamic confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on:
- **Source Authority**: Credibility and reliability of information source
- **Content Coherence**: Structural quality and logical consistency
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Number and quality of connections to other knowledge
- **Temporal Relevance**: Recency and time-sensitive importance
- **Linguistic Quality**: Readability, clarity, and grammatical correctness
- **Human Verification**: Manual review and validation status

### 2. Atomic Knowledge Units
Each note represents a single, self-contained concept that can be:
- **Independently Validated**: Each unit has its own confidence score
- **Flexibly Connected**: Links to related concepts without hierarchical constraints
- **Semantically Searchable**: Vector embeddings enable concept-based discovery
- **Evolutionarily Updated**: Confidence and connections adapt over time

### 3. Multi-Source Ingestion Pipeline
Knowledge enters the system through various channels:
- **Manual Entry**: Direct note creation with immediate high confidence
- **RSS Feeds**: Automated ingestion from trusted sources
- **Email Processing**: Important communications and newsletters
- **Web Scraping**: Targeted content extraction from websites
- **Document Processing**: PDF, Word, and other file format parsing

## System Architecture

### Knowledge Layer (Obsidian Vault)
```
vault/
├── 00-Inbox/          # New, unprocessed items
├── 01-Daily/           # Daily notes and logs
├── 02-Permanent/       # Verified, high-confidence knowledge
├── 03-Projects/        # Active projects and initiatives  
├── 04-Areas/           # Ongoing areas of responsibility
├── 05-Resources/       # Reference materials and tools
├── 06-Archives/        # Completed or obsolete items
├── _templates/         # Note creation templates
└── _attachments/       # Media and supporting files
```

### Processing Layer (MCP Servers)
- **FastAPI Server**: REST endpoints for knowledge ingestion and retrieval
- **Confidence Engine**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm
- **Embedding Generator**: Semantic vector creation for similarity search
- **Connection Analyzer**: Automatic relationship detection
- **Validation Pipeline**: Schema enforcement and quality checks

### Storage Layer (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- **Knowledge Nodes**: Core content with metadata and embeddings
- **Connection Graph**: Relationship mapping between knowledge units
- **Processing Logs**: Audit trail for all operations
- **Confidence History**: Tracking of score changes over time

### Automation Layer (n8n + Redis)
- **Ingestion Workflows**: Automated content processing pipelines
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and error handling
- **Notification System**: Alerts for review-required items
- **Backup and Sync**: Data protection and synchronization

## Confidence Scoring Algorithm

The confidence score calculation uses weighted factors:

```
confidence_score = (
    source_authority * 0.25 +
    content_coherence * 0.20 +
    cross_reference_strength * 0.20 +
    temporal_relevance * 0.15 +
    linguistic_quality * 0.10 +
    verification_status * 0.10
)
```

### Factor Definitions

1. **Source Authority (0.25 weight)**
   - Local/Manual: 1.0
   - Academic/Research: 0.9
   - Professional Documentation: 0.8
   - News Sources: 0.6-0.7
   - Social Media: 0.3-0.5
   - Unknown Sources: 0.2

2. **Content Coherence (0.20 weight)**
   - Structure quality (headers, lists, paragraphs)
   - Sentence complexity and readability
   - Logical flow and organization
   - Completeness of information

3. **Cross-Reference Strength (0.20 weight)**
   - Number of bidirectional connections
   - Quality of connected nodes
   - Network centrality metrics
   - Connection type relevance

4. **Temporal Relevance (0.15 weight)**
   - ≤7 days: 1.0
   - ≤30 days: 0.8
   - ≤90 days: 0.6
   - ≤365 days: 0.4
   - >365 days: 0.2

5. **Linguistic Quality (0.10 weight)**
   - Flesch Reading Ease score
   - Grammar and spelling accuracy
   - Terminology consistency
   - Professional writing style

6. **Verification Status (0.10 weight)**
   - Verified: 1.0
   - Processing: 0.5
   - Pending: 0.2
   - Draft: 0.1

## Quality Assurance Process

### Validation Pipeline
1. **Schema Validation**: Git pre-commit hooks ensure frontmatter compliance
2. **Content Analysis**: Automated quality scoring and categorization
3. **Cross-Reference Check**: Verification of connection validity
4. **Embedding Generation**: Semantic vector creation for similarity search
5. **Confidence Calculation**: Multi-factor scoring based on content attributes
