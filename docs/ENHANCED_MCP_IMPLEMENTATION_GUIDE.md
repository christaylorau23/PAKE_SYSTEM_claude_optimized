## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. Verify Core Infrastructure
Ensure your existing PAKE components are running:
```bash
# Check Obsidian Bridge
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check MCP Server

### 3. Configure AI Tools

#### For Claude Code:
```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "search_notes", 
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/api/search_notes",
      "method": "POST"
    },
    {
      "name": "get_note_by_id",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/api/get_note_by_id", 
      "method": "GET"
    },
    {
      "name": "notes_from_schema",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:3000/api/notes",
      "method": "POST"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### For Gemini CLI:
Use the tool definitions in `configs/claude_gemini_tools.json` to configure your Gemini integration.

2. Searches existing vault to avoid duplication
3. Extracts and processes content with proper metadata
4. Creates structured SourceNotes with confidence scores
5. Reports completion with PAKE IDs and recommendations
```

### Example 2: Knowledge Synthesis Task  
```
Prompt: "Synthesize insights about effective knowledge management systems from existing SourceNotes"

Agent Process:
1. Searches vault for relevant SourceNotes on knowledge management
2. Retrieves full content of discovered notes
3. Analyzes patterns, agreements, and contradictions
4. Creates InsightNote with novel understanding
5. Provides full traceability to source materials
```

### Example 3: Daily Review Session
```
Human Process:

## 🎛 Configuration Options

### Confidence Score Calibration
Adjust scoring thresholds in agent prompts based on your quality requirements:
- **Conservative** (current): Lower scores, more human review
- **Balanced**: Medium scores, moderate review load
- **Aggressive**: Higher scores, minimal review (not recommended initially)

### Review Queue Prioritization
Modify dashboard queries to focus on:
- **Confidence threshold**: What score triggers review?
- **Content types**: Which note types need more oversight?
- **Source categories**: Which sources require extra validation?

### Agent Instruction Tuning
Fine-tune agent behavior by modifying:
- **Source selection criteria**: What makes a good source?
- **Synthesis requirements**: What constitutes valuable insight?
- **Quality thresholds**: When should content be quarantined?
