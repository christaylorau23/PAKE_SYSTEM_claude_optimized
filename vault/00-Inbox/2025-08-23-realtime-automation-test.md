# Real-Time Automation Test

This note is being created to test the real-time automation capabilities of the PAKE system.

## Test Objective
Verify that when a new note is added to Obsidian, it is automatically:
1. Detected by the file watcher
2. Processed for confidence scoring
3. Enhanced with AI-generated metadata
4. Added to the knowledge graph
5. Vector embedded for semantic search

## Content for Analysis
This note contains structured content with headers, lists, and technical details that should result in a medium-to-high confidence score.

### Technical Details
- **System**: PAKE+ Knowledge Management
- **Component**: Automated Vault Watcher
- **Processing**: Real-time file monitoring
- **Expected Score**: 0.5-0.7 (medium confidence)

### Code Example
```python
def real_time_processing(file_path):
    """Process file in real-time when detected"""
    confidence = analyze_content(file_path)
    embed_vector(file_path)
    update_knowledge_graph(file_path)
    return confidence
```

## Analysis Factors
This note should score well on:
- **Length**: Medium-length content (0.15 points)
- **Structure**: Headers, lists, code blocks (0.2 points) 
- **Source**: Local system (0.15 points)
- **Tags**: Will be added automatically
- **Connections**: Will be established through processing

## Expected Outcome
The automation system should detect this file creation and automatically process it within seconds, adding PAKE metadata to the frontmatter including:
- `pake_id`
- `confidence_score`
- `last_processed`
- `ai_summary`
- `automated_processing: true`

Let's see if this works in real-time!
