- **🔄 Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback on deployment failures

### 3. Test Coverage Gate Implementation

**pytest-cov Integration** with minimum thresholds:

- **Unit Tests**: 85% minimum coverage (Required)
- **Integration Tests**: 80% minimum coverage (Required)
- **E2E Tests**: 75% minimum coverage (Required)
- **Overall Coverage**: 85% minimum threshold with PR comments
- **Coverage Reports**: Combined XML and HTML reports for analysis

### 4. Supporting Scripts and Tools

**Comprehensive Testing and Validation Suite**:

- **`security_test_suite.py`**: Authentication bypass, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, rate limiting, security headers, input validation
- **`performance_test_suite.py`**: Response times, concurrent requests, memory usage, database performance
- **`validate_production_health.py`**: SSL certificates, health endpoints, response times, database connectivity
- **`generate_deployment_report.py`**: Comprehensive deployment reports with metrics and recommendations
- **`validate_cicd_pipeline.py`**: Pipeline validation and configuration checking

### 5. Configuration and Dependencies

**Enhanced Project Configuration**:

- **pyproject.toml**: Added pip-audit, httpx, and other CI/CD dependencies
- **Coverage Configuration**: Comprehensive coverage settings with exclusions
- **Pytest Configuration**: Matrix testing, markers, and parallel execution
- **Security Tools**: Bandit, Safety, pip-audit integration
