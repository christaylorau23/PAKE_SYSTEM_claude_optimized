## ‚ö° Quick Actions

### Review Workflow Checklist

For each note in the priority queue:

- [ ] **Read the full content** - Does it make sense and provide value?
- [ ] **Verify the source** - Is the source_uri accurate and authoritative?
- [ ] **Check confidence score** - Does it match your assessment?
- [ ] **Review tags** - Are they specific and discoverable?
- [ ] **Validate connections** - Are related notes properly linked?
- [ ] **Update status**: 
  - ‚úÖ `verified` - Accurate and valuable
  - ‚ùå `rejected` - Inaccurate or not valuable  
  - üîÑ `refined` - Edited and improved
- [ ] **Add human notes** - Document any changes or observations

### Batch Actions

```markdown
<!-- Quick templates for common review actions -->

## Approve Note Template
**Action**: Update frontmatter
```yaml
verification_status: verified
status: refined
human_notes: "Reviewed {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} - Content verified and valuable"
```

## Quarantine Note Template  
**Action**: Update frontmatter
```yaml
verification_status: rejected
status: quarantined
human_notes: "Quarantined {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} - [Reason for quarantine]"
```

## Request Revision Template
**Action**: Update frontmatter
```yaml  
verification_status: pending
human_notes: "Needs revision: [Specific feedback] - {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}"
```
```

---

## üéØ Focus Areas for Today

### Suggested Review Priorities

1. **High Impact, Low Confidence**: Notes with important topics but low confidence scores
2. **Recent Synthesis**: New InsightNotes that combine multiple sources
3. **Error Resolution**: Any notes flagged with processing errors
4. **Batch Processing**: Groups of related notes from the same ingestion session

### Learning Opportunities

Look for patterns in:
- **Common confidence issues** - What causes low scores?
- **Source quality patterns** - Which sources consistently provide value?
- **Tagging effectiveness** - Are notes discoverable with current tags?
- **Synthesis quality** - Do InsightNotes provide genuine new value?
