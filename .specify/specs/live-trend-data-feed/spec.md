# Feature Specification: Live Trend Data Feed

**Feature Branch**: `trend-data-feed`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement comprehensive real-time trend data feed system integrating Google Trends API, YouTube Data API v3, Twitter/X API, and TikTok Research API for investment intelligence with 2-6 month early trend detection capability, sub-second analysis performance, and geographic trend correlation"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Investment analysts and wealth managers need early detection of emerging trends 2-6 months before mainstream adoption to identify high-potential investment opportunities across multiple asset classes (stocks, ETFs, crypto, commodities).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an emerging technology trend starting on TikTok, **When** the system detects viral velocity above threshold, **Then** correlated investment opportunities are identified within 2 seconds
2. **Given** Google Trends showing search volume increase for a topic, **When** cross-platform correlation analysis runs, **Then** confidence scores and investment timing recommendations are generated
3. **Given** multiple geographic regions showing trend adoption, **When** regional analysis is performed, **Then** market penetration predictions and risk assessments are provided
4. **Given** a trend reaches predetermined momentum threshold, **When** investment opportunities are mapped, **Then** portfolio recommendations with risk scores are delivered to analysts

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external APIs reach rate limits during peak analysis periods?
- How does system handle conflicting trend signals across different platforms?
- What occurs when trend data shows regional variations that contradict global patterns?
- How does system respond to API service outages while maintaining trend detection capability?
