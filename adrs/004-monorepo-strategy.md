# ADR-004: Monorepo Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PAKE System requires a repository strategy that supports our microservices architecture while maintaining code quality, dependency management, and development efficiency.

## Decision
We will use a **monorepo** strategy for the PAKE System.

## Rationale

### Monorepo Advantages:
- **Unified Dependency Management**: Single source of truth for all dependencies
- **Atomic Changes**: Cross-service changes can be made atomically
- **Shared Code**: Easy sharing of common libraries and utilities
- **Simplified CI/CD**: Single pipeline for all services
- **Large-scale Refactoring**: Easier to perform large-scale code changes
- **Consistent Tooling**: Unified linting, formatting, and testing across all services
- **Simplified Onboarding**: New developers can see the entire system in one place

### Multi-repo Comparison:
- **Pros**: Service isolation, independent deployment cycles
- **Cons**: Dependency management complexity, cross-service changes difficult, duplicated tooling

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Simplified dependency management and versioning
- Atomic cross-service changes and deployments
- Shared libraries and utilities across services
- Unified development and CI/CD workflows
- Easier large-scale refactoring and code evolution
- Consistent code quality and standards

### Negative:
- Larger repository size and clone times
- Potential for tight coupling between services
- Single point of failure for CI/CD pipeline
- More complex access control and permissions

## Implementation Plan:
1. Organize repository structure with clear service boundaries
2. Implement shared libraries in `pkgs/` directory
3. Set up unified CI/CD pipeline with service-specific builds
4. Configure dependency management with Poetry for Python services
5. Implement service-specific deployment strategies
6. Set up monitoring and observability across all services

## Repository Structure:
