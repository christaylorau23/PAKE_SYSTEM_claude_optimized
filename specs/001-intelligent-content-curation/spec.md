# Feature Specification: Intelligent Content Curation

**Feature Branch**: `001-intelligent-content-curation`
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "intelligent-content-curation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need an intelligent system that automatically discovers, evaluates, and recommends relevant content from multiple sources based on their interests, research topics, and past interactions. The system should learn from user behavior to improve recommendations over time and surface high-quality, authoritative content while filtering noise.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has specified research interests in "machine learning" and "healthcare", **When** new content is ingested from multiple sources, **Then** the system automatically identifies and prioritizes content matching these interests
2. **Given** a user frequently engages with academic papers over blog posts, **When** presenting content recommendations, **Then** the system weights academic sources higher in the ranking
3. **Given** a user has previously saved or favorited specific content, **When** new similar content is discovered, **Then** the system surfaces related recommendations based on content similarity
4. **Given** multiple content items exist on the same topic, **When** presenting to the user, **Then** the system deduplicates and ranks by authority, recency, and relevance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user interests conflict or are contradictory?
- How does system handle completely new users with no interaction history?
- What occurs when content sources are temporarily unavailable?
- How does system behave when content quality scores are ambiguous?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically analyze and categorize incoming content from multiple sources
- **FR-002**: System MUST learn from user interactions (saves, shares, time spent) to improve recommendations
- **FR-003**: System MUST rank content based on relevance, authority, and user preferences
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect and filter duplicate or near-duplicate content
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide personalized content feeds for individual users
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to specify and modify their content interests and preferences
- **FR-007**: System MUST evaluate content quality and credibility [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific quality metrics not defined]
- **FR-008**: System MUST support content filtering by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: filtering criteria not specified - date range, source type, content format?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide explanations for why specific content was recommended [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: level of detail for explanations not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle user feedback on recommendations to improve future suggestions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: feedback mechanism not defined - thumbs up/down, detailed ratings, categories?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Item**: Represents individual pieces of content with metadata (title, source, date, topic tags, quality score, user engagement metrics)
- **User Profile**: Represents user preferences, interaction history, interest categories, and personalization settings
- **Content Source**: Represents external data sources with reliability ratings, update frequencies, and content type classifications
- **Recommendation**: Represents generated suggestions with relevance scores, reasoning, and user feedback tracking
- **Topic Category**: Represents content classification system with hierarchical relationships and keyword associations
