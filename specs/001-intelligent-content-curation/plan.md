# Implementation Plan: Intelligent Content Curation

**Branch**: `001-intelligent-content-curation` | **Date**: 2025-01-23 | **Spec**: /specs/001-intelligent-content-curation/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-intelligent-content-curation/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Intelligent content curation system that automatically discovers, analyzes, and recommends relevant content to users based on their interests, behavior patterns, and preferences. The system uses ML-powered content analysis, user preference learning, and real-time recommendation generation with sub-second response times.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ with async/await patterns  
**Primary Dependencies**: scikit-learn, FastAPI, NLTK, NumPy, Pandas, Redis, PostgreSQL  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL for persistent data, Redis for caching, in-memory for L1 cache  
**Testing**: pytest with comprehensive coverage, integration tests with real dependencies  
**Target Platform**: Linux server with Docker containerization  
**Project Type**: web (backend API + frontend dashboard)  
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second recommendation generation, <100ms cached responses, 1000+ concurrent users  
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 response time, <500MB memory per service, enterprise security standards  
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ users, 1M+ content items, 50+ concurrent recommendations per second  

## Constitution Check

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - backend API + frontend dashboard

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Generated:
1. **ML Algorithm Selection**: Research best ML algorithms for content recommendation (collaborative filtering vs content-based vs hybrid)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Research optimal feature extraction techniques for content analysis
3. **Performance Optimization**: Research caching strategies and performance optimization for real-time recommendations
4. **Integration Patterns**: Research integration patterns with existing PAKE system services
5. **Security Considerations**: Research authentication and authorization patterns for recommendation APIs

### Consolidated Findings in research.md:
- **Decision**: Hybrid recommendation approach (content-based + collaborative filtering)
- **Rationale**: Provides best accuracy and handles cold-start problems
- **Alternatives considered**: Pure collaborative filtering (poor cold-start), pure content-based (limited personalization)

- **Decision**: Multi-level caching (L1: in-memory, L2: Redis, L3: database)
- **Rationale**: Sub-second response requirements with enterprise scalability
- **Alternatives considered**: Single-level caching (insufficient performance), database-only (too slow)

- **Decision**: FastAPI with async/await patterns
- **Rationale**: High performance, automatic OpenAPI docs, Python ecosystem integration
- **Alternatives considered**: Django (too heavy), Flask (no async), Node.js (ecosystem mismatch)

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### 1. Data Model (data-model.md)
**Entities extracted from feature spec**:
- **ContentItem**: title, content_text, author, source_url, published_date, content_type, tags, quality_score, credibility_score, engagement_metrics
- **UserProfile**: user_id, interests, preference_weights, learning_rate, exploration_factor, interaction_history
- **UserInteraction**: user_id, content_id, interaction_type, timestamp, session_duration, context
- **Recommendation**: content_id, user_id, relevance_score, confidence_score, reasoning, created_at
- **ContentSource**: source_name, authority_score, reliability_score, update_frequency, content_types
- **TopicCategory**: category_name, keywords, parent_category, content_count

### 2. API Contracts (/contracts/)
**Endpoints generated from functional requirements**:
- `POST /curate` - Get personalized recommendations
- `POST /feedback` - Submit user feedback
- `GET /recommendations/{user_id}` - Get user recommendations
- `GET /health` - System health check
- `POST /retrain` - Retrain ML models
- `GET /stats` - Performance statistics

### 3. Contract Tests
**One test file per endpoint**:
- `test_curate_endpoint.py` - Tests POST /curate
- `test_feedback_endpoint.py` - Tests POST /feedback
- `test_recommendations_endpoint.py` - Tests GET /recommendations/{user_id}
- `test_health_endpoint.py` - Tests GET /health
- `test_retrain_endpoint.py` - Tests POST /retrain
- `test_stats_endpoint.py` - Tests GET /stats

### 4. Integration Test Scenarios (quickstart.md)
**User stories → integration tests**:
- New user onboarding and preference learning
- Content discovery and recommendation generation
- User feedback processing and model improvement
- System performance and health monitoring

### 5. Agent Context Update
**Updated CLAUDE.md with new curation system context**

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| 3 projects (api, ml-pipeline, dashboard) | Separation of concerns, independent scaling | Single project would create tight coupling and deployment complexity |
| ML pipeline complexity | Enterprise-grade recommendation accuracy | Simple rule-based system insufficient for user satisfaction |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
