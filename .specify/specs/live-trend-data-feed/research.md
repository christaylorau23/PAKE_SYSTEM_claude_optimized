# Research: Live Trend Data Feed APIs and Architecture

## API Research Findings

### 1. Official Google Trends API Analysis

**Decision**: Use official Google Trends API (alpha) over pytrends
**Rationale**:
- Consistently scaled data across queries (unlike 0-100 UI normalization)
- Enhanced comparison capabilities for dozens of terms simultaneously
- Efficient time range extensions without reprocessing historical data
- Real-time trending queries with geographic filtering
- Enterprise reliability and rate limit management
**Alternatives considered**: pytrends (unofficial scraping), SerpAPI Google Trends
**Implementation**: Direct API integration with oauth2 authentication

### 2. TikTok Research API Investigation

**Decision**: Use TikTok Research API for comprehensive trend analysis
**Rationale**:
- Access to trending content, creator insights, and engagement metrics
- Geographic trend variations and demographic data
- Viral velocity measurement for early trend detection
- Creator adoption pattern tracking for validation signals
**Alternatives considered**: Third-party TikTok scrapers, social listening tools
**Implementation**: TikTok for Developers account with Research API access

### 3. Twitter/X API v2 Configuration

**Decision**: Twitter API v2 with Academic Research or Enterprise tier
**Rationale**:
- Real-time trending hashtags and conversation analysis
- Advanced filtering and geographic targeting
- Historical data access for trend validation
- Robust rate limiting for enterprise usage
**Alternatives considered**: Twitter API v1.1, third-party social monitoring
**Implementation**: Bearer token authentication with rate limit optimization

### 4. YouTube Data API v3 Strategy

**Decision**: YouTube Data API v3 for trending content analysis
**Rationale**:
- Access to trending videos by category and region
- Creator channel analytics for adoption patterns
- Video engagement metrics for trend momentum
- Category-specific trend detection capabilities
**Alternatives considered**: YouTube RSS feeds, unofficial APIs
**Implementation**: Google Cloud API key with quota management

### 5. Redis Streams Architecture

**Decision**: Redis Streams for real-time trend data processing
**Rationale**:
- Built-in persistence and replay capabilities
- Consumer group support for parallel processing
- Low latency streaming with PAKE's existing Redis infrastructure
- Automatic partitioning and load balancing
**Alternatives considered**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, direct database writes
**Implementation**: Redis 6+ with stream-based event processing

### 6. Multi-API Rate Limiting Strategy

**Decision**: Intelligent rate limiting with exponential backoff and request queuing
**Rationale**:
- Cost optimization across multiple paid APIs
- Graceful degradation during rate limit periods
- Request prioritization based on trend urgency
- Automatic fallback to cached data when necessary
**Alternatives considered**: Simple rate limiting, round-robin request distribution
**Implementation**: Token bucket algorithm with API-specific configurations

## Architecture Research Conclusions

### Event-Driven Streaming Pattern
```
External APIs → Redis Streams → Stream Processors → Correlation Engine → Investment Intelligence
     ↓              ↓               ↓                   ↓                    ↓
Rate Limiting   Message Queue   Real-time Analysis   Cross-platform      Portfolio Signals
Cost Control    Event Routing   Trend Detection      Correlation         Risk Assessment
Fallback Logic  Load Balancing  Geographic Agg.      Confidence Scoring  Timing Optimization
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **Caching**: Multi-level cache with TTL optimization for trend data
- **Batching**: Intelligent request batching to minimize API calls
- **Preprocessing**: Real-time data cleaning and normalization
- **Compression**: Efficient data storage for historical trend analysis

### Cost Management Approach
- **API Quotas**: Dynamic quota allocation based on trend importance
- **Request Optimization**: Batch requests and intelligent filtering
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching for frequently accessed trends
- **Fallback Data**: Use cached/historical data during rate limit periods

### Integration Points with Existing PAKE Services
- **Trend Analysis Service**: Enhance with real-time streaming capabilities
- **Trend Detection Engine**: Integrate multi-platform correlation
- **Redis Cache Service**: Extend for streaming data with optimized TTL
- **Ingestion Orchestrator**: Add trend source coordination and fallback logic

## Technical Implementation Decisions

### Service Architecture
- **Microservices**: Each platform as independent, scalable service
- **Async Processing**: Full async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures from external API issues
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring for all external integrations

### Data Flow Design
- **Stream-First**: All trend data flows through Redis Streams
- **Event Sourcing**: Maintain complete history of trend events
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write models for optimal performance
- **Time-Series Optimization**: Efficient storage for trend time-series data

### Quality Assurance Strategy
- **Real API Testing**: Integration tests with actual external APIs
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Continuous monitoring of sub-second requirements
- **Reliability Testing**: Chaos engineering for external API failures
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of API usage and costs

This research provides the technical foundation for implementing a production-ready, enterprise-grade live trend data feed system that meets PAKE's performance and reliability standards.
