# Automated Test Note 614c6e9c

This is an automated test note to verify PAKE system processing.

## Test Parameters:
- Test ID: 614c6e9c
- Created: 2025-09-11T10:52:34.795259
- Expected processing: Automatic detection and analysis

## Content Analysis Factors:
- Medium length content (should contribute to confidence)
- Structured with headers and lists
- Contains technical information
- Has code example below

### Code Example:
```python
def test_automation():
    return "system_working"
```

## Expected Results:
- Confidence score: 0.4-0.7
- Vector embedding: 128 dimensions
- Frontmatter updated with PAKE metadata
- Knowledge graph entry created

This note should trigger the automation system to:
1. Detect the new file
2. Calculate confidence score
3. Generate vector embedding  
4. Update frontmatter with metadata
5. Add entry to knowledge graph
