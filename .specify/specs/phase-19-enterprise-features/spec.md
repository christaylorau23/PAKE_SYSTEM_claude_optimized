# Feature Specification: Phase 19 Enterprise Features

**Feature Branch**: `phase-19-enterprise-features`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Transform PAKE System into a comprehensive enterprise platform with advanced SSO integration, multi-tenant architecture, AI/ML capabilities, and business intelligence dashboard

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Enterprise organizations need a fully-featured PAKE System platform that supports multiple tenants with isolated data, advanced authentication integration (SAML/OIDC), comprehensive business analytics, and AI-powered insights for strategic decision-making across their research and knowledge management operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an enterprise customer with 10,000+ users across multiple departments, **When** they integrate PAKE System with their existing SAML/OIDC infrastructure, **Then** all users can seamlessly authenticate with their corporate credentials and access tenant-specific data

2. **Given** a multi-tenant environment with 50+ organizations, **When** each tenant performs research operations, **Then** data remains completely isolated with zero cross-tenant data leakage and sub-second performance maintained

3. **Given** executive stakeholders requiring strategic insights, **When** they access the business intelligence dashboard, **Then** they receive real-time analytics on research patterns, user engagement, knowledge discovery trends, and ROI metrics

4. **Given** research teams requiring AI assistance, **When** they use advanced AI/ML features, **Then** they receive intelligent research recommendations, automated content summarization, and predictive trend analysis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when SAML/OIDC providers experience outages during peak usage periods?
- How does the system handle tenant data migration when organizations merge or split?
- What occurs when AI/ML models require retraining with updated data while maintaining service availability?
- How does the system respond to sudden tenant scaling from 100 to 10,000 users within hours?
- What happens when business intelligence queries span terabytes of historical data?
