# ADR-003: Database Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PAKE System requires a robust database solution to support our enterprise knowledge management platform with high performance, scalability, and reliability requirements.

## Decision
We will use **PostgreSQL** as our primary database with **Redis** for caching and **Neo4j** for graph relationships.

## Rationale

### PostgreSQL Advantages:
- **ACID Compliance**: Full ACID compliance for data integrity
- **Advanced Features**: JSON support, full-text search, and advanced indexing
- **Performance**: Excellent performance with proper indexing and query optimization
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with read replicas and partitioning
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem with extensive tooling and libraries
- **Enterprise Features**: Advanced features like logical replication and backup tools
- **Vector Support**: pgvector extension for semantic search capabilities

### Redis for Caching:
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond response times for cached data
- **Data Structures**: Rich data structures for complex caching scenarios
- **Persistence**: Configurable persistence options for data durability
- **Clustering**: Built-in clustering and high availability features

### Neo4j for Graph Relationships:
- **Graph Database**: Purpose-built for relationship-heavy data
- **Cypher Query Language**: Intuitive query language for graph operations
- **Performance**: Optimized for graph traversal and relationship queries
- **ACID Compliance**: Full ACID compliance for graph data integrity

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Robust, proven database technology stack
- Excellent performance for both relational and graph data
- Strong consistency and reliability guarantees
- Rich ecosystem and community support
- Advanced features for complex queries and analytics
- Vector search capabilities for AI/ML applications

### Negative:
- Multiple database systems to manage and maintain
- Additional complexity in data synchronization
- Learning curve for Neo4j and graph database concepts
- Resource overhead for multiple database instances

## Implementation Plan:
1. Deploy PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector search
2. Set up Redis cluster for high-performance caching
3. Deploy Neo4j for knowledge graph relationships
4. Implement database connection pooling and monitoring
5. Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures
6. Configure database security and access controls
