# PAKE Governance & Quality Workflows

## Overview

The PAKE system implements a **Human-in-the-Loop** governance model that ensures AI-generated knowledge maintains high quality while enabling continuous improvement of agent performance.

---

## Core Governance Principles

### 1. Conservative Confidence
AI agents should err on the side of caution with confidence scores, allowing human reviewers to upgrade quality assessments rather than catching overconfident content.

### 2. Full Traceability  
Every piece of knowledge must be traceable back to its original source and processing decisions, enabling accountability and verification.

### 3. Graceful Degradation
System should handle errors and edge cases gracefully, quarantining questionable content rather than failing completely.

### 4. Continuous Learning
Human feedback must flow back into agent instruction refinement, creating an improving system over time.

## Quality Control Workflows

### Daily Review Process

#### Morning Routine (10-15 minutes)
1. **Open Daily Review Dashboard**
2. **Check Priority Queue**: Focus on quarantined and low-confidence items
3. **Quick Triage**: Sort items by urgency and complexity
4. **Set Daily Target**: Aim to review 15-20 items minimum

#### Review Session Process (Per Note)
1. **Context Loading**:
   - Read the note title and summary
   - Check source_uri and creation context
   - Review confidence score and current status

2. **Content Assessment**:
   - **Accuracy**: Is the information correct?
   - **Completeness**: Is critical information missing?
   - **Relevance**: Does this add value to the knowledge base?
   - **Quality**: Is it well-structured and clear?

3. **Source Verification**:
   - **Authority**: Is the source credible?
   - **Recency**: Is the information current enough?
   - **Accessibility**: Can others access/verify the source?

4. **Decision Making**:
   - ✅ **Verify**: `verification_status: verified`, `status: refined`
   - ❌ **Reject**: `verification_status: rejected`, `status: quarantined`  
   - 🔄 **Revise**: Edit content, update metadata as needed
   - ⏳ **Defer**: Mark for later review with specific notes

5. **Learning Capture**:
   - Document common issues in `human_notes`
   - Track patterns for agent instruction updates

#### Evening Reflection (5 minutes)
1. **Review Statistics**: Check daily review dashboard metrics
2. **Identify Patterns**: What issues appeared frequently?
3. **Update Agent Rules**: Add specific guidance to prevent recurring issues

### Weekly Quality Assessment

#### Sunday Planning Session (30 minutes)
1. **Review Week's Metrics**:
   - Total notes processed
   - Confidence score distributions
   - Verification ratios
   - Common issue patterns

2. **Agent Performance Analysis**:
   - Which agents are performing well?
   - What types of content cause problems?
   - Are confidence scores calibrated correctly?

3. **Instruction Refinement**:
   - Update agent prompt templates based on findings
   - Add new quality criteria or warnings
   - Refine confidence scoring guidelines

4. **System Health Check**:
   - Are all endpoints functioning?
   - Is the vault organization working well?
   - Do dashboards provide useful information?

## Agent Instruction Evolution Process

### Issue Identification
When reviewing notes, document specific problems:

**Template for Issue Logging**:
```markdown
**Issue Type**: [Source Quality | Confidence Calibration | Content Processing | Tagging]
**Frequency**: [How often this occurs]
**Example PAKE IDs**: [Specific examples]
**Current Behavior**: [What the agent did]
**Desired Behavior**: [What it should do instead]
**Proposed Fix**: [Specific instruction change]
```

### Instruction Updates

#### For Ingestion Agent:
- **Confidence Scoring**: Refine scoring criteria based on accuracy patterns
- **Source Selection**: Add criteria for source authority assessment
- **Content Processing**: Improve extraction and formatting guidelines
- **Tagging**: Enhance tag selection strategies

#### For Synthesis Agent:
- **Evidence Requirements**: Strengthen requirements for supporting claims
- **Confidence Calibration**: Adjust synthesis confidence scoring
- **Source Attribution**: Improve traceability requirements
- **Quality Thresholds**: Set minimum standards for synthesis creation

### Version Control for Agent Instructions

1. **Maintain Instruction History**:
   - Keep dated versions of agent prompt files
   - Document reasoning for each change
   - Track performance improvements over time

2. **A/B Testing Framework**:
   - Test instruction changes on small batches first
   - Compare performance metrics before/after changes
   - Rollback if changes reduce quality

3. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Each change must include rationale and expected impact
   - Link to specific examples that motivated the change
   - Include success criteria for evaluation

## Quality Metrics & KPIs

### Daily Metrics
- **Review Completion Rate**: % of priority queue addressed
- **Verification Ratio**: % of reviewed notes verified vs rejected
- **Average Confidence Calibration**: How well confidence scores match human assessment

### Weekly Metrics
- **Ingestion Quality**: Average confidence score of new SourceNotes
- **Synthesis Value**: Human rating of InsightNote usefulness
- **Error Reduction**: Decrease in quarantined notes over time
- **Processing Efficiency**: Time from ingestion to verification

### Monthly Metrics
- **Knowledge Growth**: Net increase in verified, valuable content
- **Discovery Effectiveness**: How often searches find relevant information
- **System Reliability**: Uptime and error rates for all components
- **User Satisfaction**: Subjective assessment of system value

## Crisis Management Protocols

### High Error Rates
**Trigger**: >30% of daily reviews result in rejection

**Response**:
1. Immediately pause automated ingestion
2. Analyze recent changes to agent instructions or external sources
3. Implement additional quality filters
4. Review and strengthen agent instructions
5. Resume with enhanced monitoring

### System Downtime
**Trigger**: Core services (Obsidian bridge, MCP server) unavailable

**Response**:
1. Check service status and logs
2. Restart services with known good configurations
3. Implement manual backup procedures if needed
4. Document incident and root cause
5. Implement preventive measures

### Data Quality Issues
**Trigger**: Discovery of systematic inaccuracies or biases

**Response**:
1. Identify scope and impact of quality issues
2. Quarantine affected content immediately
3. Analyze source or processing pipeline problems
4. Implement corrections and prevention measures
5. Communicate impact and resolution to stakeholders

## Advanced Quality Assurance

### Cross-Validation Strategies

1. **Source Triangulation**: Verify important claims against multiple independent sources
2. **Temporal Validation**: Check if information remains current and accurate
3. **Expert Review**: Engage domain experts for high-impact content validation
4. **Community Verification**: Use crowd-sourcing for fact-checking when appropriate

### Bias Detection and Mitigation

1. **Source Diversity Monitoring**: Track diversity of information sources
2. **Perspective Analysis**: Ensure multiple viewpoints are represented
3. **Systematic Bias Checks**: Look for patterns in what gets included/excluded
4. **Counterfactual Review**: Actively seek contradictory evidence

### Long-term Knowledge Curation

1. **Content Lifecycle Management**: Regular review and archiving of outdated information
2. **Connection Maintenance**: Update links and relationships as knowledge evolves
3. **Synthesis Evolution**: Update InsightNotes as new evidence emerges
