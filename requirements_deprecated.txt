# ⚠️  DEPRECATED: This file is deprecated in favor of Poetry
#
# PAKE System has migrated to Poetry for dependency management.
# The new unified configuration is in pyproject.toml
#
# 🔄 MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# 1. Install Poetry:
#    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
#
# 2. Run the migration script:
#    python scripts/migrate_to_poetry.py
#
# 3. Install dependencies with Poetry:
#    poetry install --with dev,trends
#
# 4. Activate Poetry environment:
#    poetry shell
#
# 5. Run tests to verify:
#    poetry run pytest tests/ -v
#
# 📋 BENEFITS OF POETRY:
# - Single pyproject.toml file instead of 11+ requirements.txt files
# - Automatic dependency resolution and conflict detection
# - Lock file for reproducible builds (poetry.lock)
# - Virtual environment management built-in
# - Organized dependency groups (main, dev, trends, docs, etc.)
# - Better CI/CD integration
#
# 📁 BACKUP: All old requirements files are backed up in backups/requirements_backup/
#
# For more information, see the Poetry section in CLAUDE.md
