## Implementation Details

### 1. Development Security

#### ✅ Security-Focused Linting
```bash
# Install security-focused linting tools
pip install ruff[security] bandit safety

# Run security linting
ruff check --select=S src/ tests/
bandit -r src/
safety check
```

#### ✅ Input Sanitization
```python
# Example from security_hardening_framework.py
async def validate_input_sanitization(self, input_data: str, input_type: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks"""
    if input_type == "sql":
        return await self._sanitize_sql_input(input_data)
    elif input_type == "html":
        return await self._sanitize_html_input(input_data)
    # ... additional sanitization methods
```

#### ✅ Secure Coding Practices
- **OWASP Top 10 Compliance**: All vulnerabilities addressed
- **Parameterized Queries**: SQL injection prevention
- **Output Encoding**: XSS prevention
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

### 2. Dependency Management

#### ✅ Automated Dependency Scanning
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

#### ✅ Vulnerability Scanning
```python
# Automated scanning in CI/CD
async def scan_dependencies(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities"""
    # Python dependencies using safety
    # Node.js dependencies using npm audit
    # Docker images using Trivy
```

### 3. CI/CD Security

#### ✅ Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
- name: Run Security Scans
  run: |
    # SAST scanning
    ruff check --select=S src/ tests/
    bandit -r src/
    safety check
    
    # Container scanning
    trivy image pake-system:latest
```

#### ✅ Security Gates
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Block on critical/high
- **SAST Findings**: Block on critical
- **Container Vulnerabilities**: Block on critical
- **Secret Detection**: Block on any secrets

### 4. Secrets Management

#### ✅ Secure Secrets Storage
```python
# secrets_manager.py implementation
class SecretsManager:
    async def store_secret(self, secret_id: str, secret_value: str, ...):
        """Store a secret securely with encryption"""
        encrypted_value = await self._encrypt_secret(secret_value)
        # Store in cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)
```

#### ✅ Secret Rotation
```python
async def rotate_secret(self, secret_id: str, new_value: str) -> bool:
    """Rotate a secret value with audit logging"""
    # Automated rotation policies
    # Audit trail for all rotations
```

### 5. Infrastructure Security

#### ✅ Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: Database encryption enabled
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Secrets**: Encrypted with AES-256

#### ✅ Access Control
```python
# RBAC implementation
class SecurityHardeningFramework:
    async def validate_REDACTED_SECRET_strength(self, REDACTED_SECRET: str) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
        """Validate REDACTED_SECRET strength according to security policy"""
        # Strong REDACTED_SECRET requirements
        # Multi-factor authentication support
```

### 6. Operations Security

#### ✅ Centralized Logging
```python
# logging_framework.py implementation
class LoggingFramework:
    async def log_structured(self, level: LogLevel, message: str, **kwargs):
        """Log structured message with security context"""
        # Structured logging with correlation IDs
        # Security event logging
        # Audit trail maintenance
```

#### ✅ Security Monitoring
```python
# security_monitoring.py implementation
class SecurityMonitoringSystem:
    async def process_security_event(self, event_type: str, ...):
        """Process security events with threat detection"""
        # Real-time threat detection
        # Automated incident response
        # Security alerting
```
