# Unified Test Runner - Completion Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED: Configure unified pytest test runner with coverage

### Key Achievements

1. **Enhanced pyproject.toml pytest configuration**:
   - Comprehensive test markers following Testing Pyramid (Unit 70%, Integration 20%, E2E 10%)
   - Coverage configuration with 80% threshold requirement
   - Parallel test execution support with pytest-xdist
   - Async test support with pytest-asyncio
   - Performance monitoring with test duration tracking
   - Timeout configuration for long-running tests

2. **Enhanced test runner script** (`scripts/run_tests.py`):
   - Unified test execution integrating with pyproject.toml configuration
   - Multiple execution modes: unit, integration, e2e, all, comprehensive
   - Parallel execution support with `--parallel` flag
   - Coverage reporting with `--coverage` flag
   - Performance metrics with `--performance` flag
   - Environment validation with `--check-env` flag
   - Quick smoke tests with `--quick` flag
   - Code quality checks with `--lint` flag

3. **Testing dependencies installed**:
   - pytest 8.4.2 (core testing framework)
   - pytest-cov 7.0.0 (coverage reporting)
   - pytest-xdist 3.8.0 (parallel execution)
   - pytest-asyncio 1.2.0 (async test support)
   - pytest-timeout 2.4.0 (test timeout management)
   - pytest-benchmark 5.1.0 (performance benchmarking)

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Default comprehensive test execution
python scripts/run_tests.py

# Comprehensive tests with parallel execution
python scripts/run_tests.py --comprehensive --parallel

# Run specific test layers
python scripts/run_tests.py unit
python scripts/run_tests.py integration
python scripts/run_tests.py e2e

# Coverage and performance monitoring
python scripts/run_tests.py --coverage --performance

# Quick development checks
python scripts/run_tests.py --quick
python scripts/run_tests.py --check-env
```

### Next Steps

The test runner infrastructure is now ready. Current test failures are expected due to:
1. Missing dependencies in some test modules
2. Legacy code paths that need cleanup
3. Server architecture consolidation needed

These issues will be addressed in the next phases:
- Identify and remove redundant/legacy code
- Implement unified server architecture
- Configure code formatters
