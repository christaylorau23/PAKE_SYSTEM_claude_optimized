PAKE System - Database N+1 Query Tests
Phase 5: Performance Under Pressure

These tests validate that eager loading is properly implemented and
N+1 queries have been eliminated from the codebase.

Test Strategy:
1. Count SQL queries executed during operations
2. Compare lazy loading (N+1) vs eager loading query counts
3. Validate that eager loading reduces queries by 50-90%
4. Assert that list operations use â‰¤3 queries regardless of result size
