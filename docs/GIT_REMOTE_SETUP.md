# PAKE System Git Remote Setup Instructions

## Option 1: GitHub Repository (Recommended)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: 'pake-system-claude-optimized' (or your preferred name)
   - Set as Private if desired
   - Do NOT initialize with README (we already have files)

2. Add the remote and push:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pake-system-claude-optimized.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Other Git Providers (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

Replace the origin URL with your provider's URL:
```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
git push -u origin main
```

## Current Repository Status:
- ✅ Local Git repository initialized
- ✅ Phase 2B complete commit with 384 files
- ✅ Professional merge history with feature branch
- ✅ Clean main branch ready for remote push
- ⏳ Remote repository setup (when ready)

## Verification Commands:
```bash
git status              # Should show 'nothing to commit, working tree clean'
git log --oneline -5    # Shows professional commit history
git branch              # Shows current branch (main)
```
