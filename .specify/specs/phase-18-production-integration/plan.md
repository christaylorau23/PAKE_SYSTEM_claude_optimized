```

**Output**: research.md with technology decisions and architectural patterns

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Service Integration Design
1. **API Gateway Architecture**:
   - Single entry point for all 50+ microservices
   - Request routing based on service discovery
   - Rate limiting and authentication integration
   - Load balancing and circuit breaker patterns

2. **Service Mesh Implementation**:
   - Automatic service discovery and registration
   - Mutual TLS for secure inter-service communication
   - Traffic management and fault injection for testing
   - Observability integration with distributed tracing

3. **Performance Optimization Framework**:
   - Database connection pooling with dynamic scaling
   - Multi-level Redis caching with intelligent invalidation
   - Query optimization and database schema tuning
   - CDN integration for static content delivery

### Contract Generation Strategy
1. **API Gateway Contracts** (`/contracts/api-gateway.yaml`):
   - OpenAPI 3.1 specification for unified API surface
   - Authentication and authorization requirements
   - Rate limiting policies and quota management
   - Request/response transformation rules

2. **Service Mesh Contracts** (`/contracts/service-mesh.yaml`):
   - Service discovery and registration protocols
   - Inter-service communication patterns
   - Security policies and mTLS configuration
   - Traffic management and load balancing rules

3. **Monitoring Contracts** (`/contracts/monitoring.yaml`):
   - Prometheus metrics exposition format
   - Health check endpoint specifications
   - Distributed tracing context propagation
   - Alert rule definitions and escalation procedures

4. **Performance Contracts** (`/contracts/performance.yaml`):
   - SLA definitions and performance metrics
   - Auto-scaling trigger conditions
   - Resource allocation and limit specifications
   - Benchmark testing requirements

### Data Model Design
```
Service Registry:
- service_id: UUID (Primary Key)
- service_name: String (Unique)
- service_version: Semantic Version
- endpoints: List[ServiceEndpoint]
- health_check_url: URL
- dependencies: List[ServiceDependency]
- resource_requirements: ResourceSpec
- scaling_config: AutoScalingConfig

Performance Metrics:
- metric_id: UUID (Primary Key)
- service_id: UUID (Foreign Key)
- metric_name: String
- metric_value: Float
- metric_unit: String
- timestamp: DateTime
- labels: Dict[String, String]

Configuration Management:
- config_id: UUID (Primary Key)
- service_id: UUID (Foreign Key)
- config_key: String
- config_value: JSON
- environment: Enum[dev, staging, production]
- version: Integer
- created_at: DateTime
```

### Testing Framework Design
1. **Contract Tests**: Validate API specifications and service contracts
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service-to-service communication patterns
3. **Load Tests**: Validate performance under concurrent user scenarios
4. **Chaos Tests**: Failure injection and recovery validation

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md update

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as constitutional foundation
- Generate infrastructure-first tasks (Kubernetes, databases, monitoring)
- Create service integration tasks in dependency order
- Implement performance optimization tasks with benchmarking
- Add observability tasks with comprehensive coverage validation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure foundation: Database, Redis, Kubernetes setup
- Core service orchestration: API Gateway, Service Mesh
- Performance optimization: Connection pooling, caching, query optimization
- Observability integration: Metrics, tracing, logging, alerting
- Validation and testing: Load testing, chaos engineering, SLA validation

**Task Categorization**:
- [INFRA] Infrastructure and platform setup tasks
- [ORCH] Service orchestration and API gateway tasks
- [PERF] Performance optimization and scaling tasks
- [OBS] Observability and monitoring tasks
- [TEST] Testing, validation, and benchmarking tasks
- [P] Parallel execution capability (independent tasks)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Infrastructure implementation (Kubernetes, databases, monitoring stack)
**Phase 5**: Service integration (API Gateway, Service Mesh, performance optimization)
**Phase 6**: Observability implementation (metrics, tracing, logging, alerting)
**Phase 7**: Testing and validation (load testing, chaos engineering, SLA validation)
**Phase 8**: Production deployment and operational handoff
