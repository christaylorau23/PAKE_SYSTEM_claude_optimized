# PAKE System Constitution
*Enterprise-Grade Knowledge Management & AI Research Platform*

## Core Principles

### I. Service-First Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature must be implemented as a self-contained service within `src/services/[category]/`. Services must be independently testable, documented with comprehensive type annotations, and follow the established async/await patterns. All services must implement graceful degradation and circuit breaker patterns for external API dependencies.

### II. Production-Ready Standards
All code must meet enterprise production standards: comprehensive error handling, proper logging, environment-based configuration (never hard-coded secrets), and sub-second performance requirements. The system must maintain 100% test coverage and pass all linting checks before deployment.

### III. Multi-Source Integration Excellence
The omni-source ingestion pipeline is the core differentiator. All new integrations must support the established orchestration patterns, implement intelligent caching at the service level, and provide graceful fallback mechanisms. Performance must remain sub-second for multi-source operations.

### IV. Type Safety & Documentation
TypeScript strict mode is mandatory for all frontend/bridge components. Python services require comprehensive type hints and dataclass patterns. All public APIs must be documented with clear examples and error scenarios. Real-time API documentation through OpenAPI/Swagger is required.

### V. Security & Environment Management
Never commit secrets to version control. All configuration through environment variables with proper validation. Implement proper authentication patterns (JWT for API access), input validation, and audit logging. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment are mandatory for all external integrations.

## Technology Standards

### Required Technology Stack
- **Python 3.12+**: Core backend services with async/await patterns
- **TypeScript/Node.js v22+**: Bridge services and frontend components
- **Redis**: Enterprise multi-level caching (L1: in-memory, L2: Redis)
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with async SQLAlchemy
- **Docker**: Containerization for all deployments
- **Real APIs Only**: Production Firecrawl, PubMed, ArXiv integrations

### Performance Requirements
- Sub-second multi-source research operations
- Sub-millisecond response times for cached queries
- 100% test success rate maintenance
- Graceful degradation under load
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Development Workflow

### Spec-Kit Integration Process
1. **Planning Phase**: Use `/specify` command for feature specifications
2. **Implementation Planning**: Use `/plan` command for technical implementation details
3. **Task Breakdown**: Use `/tasks` command for systematic development steps
4. **Tool Handoff**: Claude Code for planning → Cursor for implementation → Claude Code for refactoring

### Quality Gates
- All features require comprehensive test coverage
- Performance tests must validate sub-second requirements
- Security review mandatory for external integrations
- Documentation updates required for all API changes
- Enterprise deployment validation before production release

### Code Review Standards
- Type safety verification (Python + TypeScript)
- Performance impact assessment
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Integration test validation
- Documentation completeness check

## Enterprise Architecture Requirements

### Scalability & Reliability
- Stateless service design for horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling and optimization
- Caching strategies for all expensive operations
- Monitoring and alerting for all critical paths
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies

### Integration Patterns
- Consistent API response formats across all services
- Standardized error handling and logging patterns
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Comprehensive observability and telemetry

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and serves as the definitive guide for PAKE System development. All feature development, code reviews, and architectural decisions must align with these principles.

### Amendment Process
- Constitution changes require documentation and team approval
- Breaking changes must include migration plans
- All modifications must maintain backward compatibility
- Version control and change tracking mandatory

### Compliance Verification
- All PRs must verify constitutional compliance
- Automated checks for security and performance standards
- Regular architecture reviews and system health assessments
- Continuous improvement based on production metrics
