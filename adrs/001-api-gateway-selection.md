# ADR-001: API Gateway Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PAKE System requires an API gateway to handle routing, authentication, rate limiting, and load balancing for our microservices architecture. We need to evaluate between Kong and Tyk for our enterprise-grade platform.

## Decision
We will use **Kong** as our API gateway solution.

## Rationale

### Kong Advantages:
- **Enterprise Features**: Kong Enterprise provides advanced features like RBAC, analytics, and enterprise support
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extensive plugin ecosystem with 100+ plugins for various integrations
- **Performance**: High-performance proxy with sub-millisecond latency
- **Kubernetes Native**: Excellent Kubernetes integration with Kong Ingress Controller
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, logging, and tracing capabilities
- **Security**: Advanced security features including OAuth2, JWT, and API key management
- **Scalability**: Proven at scale with major enterprises

### Tyk Comparison:
- **Pros**: Good developer experience, reasonable pricing
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less enterprise features, limited Kubernetes integration

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Enterprise-grade API management capabilities
- Excellent Kubernetes integration for our containerized architecture
- Comprehensive plugin ecosystem for future integrations
- Strong observability and monitoring features
- Proven scalability and performance

### Negative:
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Kong
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Cost considerations for Kong Enterprise features

## Implementation Plan:
1. Deploy Kong Gateway in Kubernetes using Helm
2. Configure Kong Ingress Controller for service routing
3. Implement authentication plugins (JWT, OAuth2)
4. Set up rate limiting and security policies
5. Configure monitoring and observability
