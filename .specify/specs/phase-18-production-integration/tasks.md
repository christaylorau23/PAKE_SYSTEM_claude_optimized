   → contracts/: 4 contract files (api-gateway, service-mesh, monitoring, performance)
   → quickstart.md: Deployment and validation procedures
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: infrastructure, dependencies, database
   → Tests: 4 contract tests + 12 integration tests

## Task Generation Rules Applied

✅ **From Contracts**: 4 contract files → 6 contract test tasks [P]
✅ **From Data Model**: 10+ entities → 10 model creation tasks [P]
✅ **From User Stories**: Performance scenarios → 12 integration tests [P]
✅ **TDD Ordering**: All tests (T007-T024) before implementation (T025+)
✅ **Parallel Marking**: Different files marked [P], shared files sequential
✅ **File Path Specificity**: Every task includes exact file path

## Validation Checklist

✅ All contracts have corresponding tests (T007-T012)
✅ All entities have model tasks (T025-T034)
✅ All tests come before implementation (T007-T024 → T025+)
✅ Parallel tasks truly independent (different files/components)
✅ Each task specifies exact file path
✅ No task modifies same file as another [P] task
✅ Performance SLAs have validation tests (T065-T068)
✅ TDD methodology strictly enforced (tests fail first)

**READY FOR EXECUTION**: 72 numbered tasks with clear dependencies, parallel execution guidance, and TDD enforcement. Each task is specific enough for autonomous LLM completion with comprehensive file paths and validation procedures.
