## 🔑 Authentication Setup (Required Next Step)

**⚠️ You must complete this step interactively:**

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt
Open a **new command prompt** and navigate to your PAKE directory:
```cmd
cd D:\Projects\PAKE_SYSTEM
```

### Step 2: Start Gemini CLI
```cmd
gemini
```

### Step 3: Complete Google OAuth
- Choose "Login with Google" when prompted
- Complete OAuth flow in your browser with your Google account
- Return to terminal when authentication is complete

### Step 4: Test Basic Functionality
```cmd
gemini --prompt "Hello! Confirm that authentication is working."
```

## 🛠 PAKE System Integration

### Step 5: Ensure PAKE Services Are Running

Before using Gemini with PAKE, make sure your services are active:

```cmd
# Check Obsidian Bridge
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check MCP Server  
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

If not running, start them using your existing PAKE startup scripts.

### Step 6: Configure MCP Servers

Run the automated setup:
```cmd
setup_gemini_mcp.bat
```

Or manually add the servers:
```cmd
gemini mcp add pake-obsidian http://localhost:3000
gemini mcp add pake-server http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 7: Run Integration Tests

Execute the test suite:
```cmd
test_gemini_integration.bat
```

This will verify:
- Gemini CLI authentication ✓
- PAKE service connectivity ✓
- MCP server integration ✓
- Basic tool functionality ✓

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Research Workflow (Ingestion Agent)
```cmd
gemini --prompt "Act as a PAKE Ingestion Agent. Research the latest developments in 'AI-assisted software development' and create comprehensive SourceNotes with proper metadata and confidence scoring."
```

### Knowledge Synthesis (Synthesis Agent)  
```cmd
gemini --prompt "Act as a PAKE Synthesis Agent. Search my vault for notes about 'knowledge management' and create an InsightNote that synthesizes the key principles and best practices from multiple sources."
```

### Vault Management
```cmd
# Search existing notes
gemini --prompt "Search my PAKE vault for notes tagged with 'AI' and 'development'"

# Get specific note content
gemini --prompt "Retrieve the full content of the note with PAKE ID: [your-pake-id]"

# Create new structured note
gemini --prompt "Create a new SourceNote about 'Claude Code features' with proper PAKE metadata"
```

### Daily Review Assistance
```cmd
gemini --prompt "Help me review my PAKE vault. Show me notes that need verification and suggest which ones should be prioritized for review today."
```
