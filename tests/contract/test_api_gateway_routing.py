Contract Test: API Gateway Service Routing
Task T008 - Phase 18 Production System Integration

This test validates the API Gateway service routing contract as defined in:
.specify/specs/phase-18-production-integration/contracts/api-gateway.yaml

CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL before implementation exists.
This follows TDD methodology - Red, Green, Refactor.
