# ADR-002: Service Mesh Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PAKE System requires a service mesh to provide service-to-service communication, security, observability, and traffic management for our microservices architecture. We need to evaluate between Istio and Linkerd.

## Decision
We will use **Istio** as our service mesh solution.

## Rationale

### Istio Advantages:
- **Comprehensive Feature Set**: Full-featured service mesh with traffic management, security, and observability
- **Kubernetes Native**: Deep integration with Kubernetes ecosystem
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Widely adopted by major enterprises and cloud providers
- **Advanced Traffic Management**: Sophisticated traffic routing, load balancing, and circuit breaking
- **Security**: mTLS by default, RBAC, and policy enforcement
- **Observability**: Rich metrics, distributed tracing, and service topology
- **Community**: Large, active community with extensive documentation

### Linkerd Comparison:
- **Pros**: Simpler architecture, lower resource overhead, easier to operate
- **Cons**: Less feature-rich, smaller ecosystem, limited advanced traffic management

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Comprehensive service mesh capabilities out of the box
- Advanced traffic management for complex routing scenarios
- Strong security posture with mTLS and policy enforcement
- Rich observability and monitoring capabilities
- Strong Kubernetes integration and ecosystem support
- Enterprise-grade features and support

### Negative:
- Higher complexity and resource overhead
- Steeper learning curve for operations team
- More configuration required for optimal performance
- Potential performance impact due to sidecar proxy overhead

## Implementation Plan:
1. Install Istio using Helm in Kubernetes cluster
2. Configure automatic sidecar injection for namespaces
3. Set up mTLS for service-to-service communication
4. Configure traffic management policies and routing rules
5. Implement observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger
6. Set up security policies and RBAC
