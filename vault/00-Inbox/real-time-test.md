# Real-Time Automation Test

This note was just created to test the real-time automation capabilities of the PAKE+ system.

## Features Being Tested

1. **Automatic Detection**: The system should detect this new file within 5 seconds
2. **Confidence Scoring**: It should calculate a confidence score based on content structure
3. **Vector Embedding**: It should create a 128-dimensional vector embedding
4. **AI Summary**: It should generate an intelligent summary in the frontmatter

## Content Characteristics

This note includes:
- Multiple headers for good structure
- Numbered and bulleted lists
- Technical terminology
- Clear organization

The automation system should process this automatically and add all the necessary metadata to the frontmatter.
